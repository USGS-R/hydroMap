# hydroMap

This package is NOT CURRENTLY supported. 

Please consider using the [NHDPlusTools](https://github.com/usgs-r/nhdplusTools) package. A similar workflow that captures the functions of this package are described here:

[https://usgs-r.github.io/nhdplusTools/articles/plot_nhdplus.html](https://usgs-r.github.io/nhdplusTools/articles/plot_nhdplus.html)


### Package Support

The Water Mission Area of the USGS supported the exploration of the development of the `hydroMaps` R-package. This package is not currently active.

### Sunset date 

There is no current funding for `hydroMaps`. Users should be aware that they use this package at their own risk. 

# Installation

To install the `hydroMap` package, first install the "remotes" package. Then run the following R code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("USGS-R/hydroMap")
```

`hydroMaps` depends on the R packages `sp`,`rgeos`, and `rgdal` all of which require an external library gdal to be installed. See :

https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/gdal/



## Create Interactive Graphs using Leaflet:
```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE} 
library(leaflet)
basins <- getBasin(sites)
Range=c(-81,-73,38,44)
flowLines <- getFlowLines(Range, streamorder = 5)

leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>% 
  setView(-78, 41, zoom = 6) %>%
  addPolygons(data=basins, weight=2, color = "grey") %>%
  addPolylines(data=flowLines, weight=1) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(siteInfo$dec_long_va,siteInfo$dec_lat_va,
                   color = "red",
                   radius=4,
                   stroke=FALSE,
                   fillOpacity = 0.8, opacity = 0.8,
                   popup=siteInfo$station_nm)

```
