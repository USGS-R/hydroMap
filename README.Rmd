#Installation

##Windows

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("hydroMaps", 
    repos = c("http://owi.usgs.gov/R", "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))
```

##Mac and Unix

`hydroMaps` depends on the R packages `sp`,`rgeos`, and `rgdal` all of which require an external library gdal to be installed. See :

https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/gdal/


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("hydroMaps", 
    repos = c("http://owi.usgs.gov/R", "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))
```


# Sample Workflow
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(dataRetrieval)
library(hydroMap)

sites <- c("01491000", "01573000", "01576000")

siteInfo <- readNWISsite(sites)
# png("test.png",width=11,height=8,units="in",res=600,pointsize=4)
plotWSB(sites)
points(siteInfo$dec_long_va, siteInfo$dec_lat_va, pch=20, col="red", cex=2)
# dev.off()

```
